# Adventure Works Project

This is a project done to create a dashboard for a fictional company, **Adventure Works**, to give an executive view/summary of their sales performance,
along with details on company performance by region, product and a look at customer data.

There are som additional hidden pages not meant to be part of the final report but just showcasing some of Power BI's AI capabilities and upgrades for an 
understanding of how those upgrades could be implemented in the report.
