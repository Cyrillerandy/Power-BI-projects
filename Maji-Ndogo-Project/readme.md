# ALX Maji Ndogo Project

This was a school project aimed at helping the leaders of a fictional nation, Maji Ndogo, deal with their crippling water crisis. 

It involves visual reports giving a breakdown of the situation nationally and by province, while also highlighting the issues that need
fixing.

This is the final project with data assuming all problems have been fixes. Data sources for both this final version and the previous state
where there was still work to be done are attached to be able to see how the dashboard will work with data updates.
